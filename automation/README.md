## Lab Descriptions

### Lab 01

This lab is organized into several subdirectories, each focusing on a different aspect of the lab's objectives:

- **calculations/**: Contains scripts for performing various calculations needed for the lab.
- **serial/**: Scripts related to serial communication.
- **simulation/**: Contains simulation scripts to model and analyze different scenarios.
- **test/**: Testing scripts to validate the lab's objectives.
- **wifi/**: Scripts related to WiFi communication and testing.

### Lab 02

This lab focuses on motor control, signal generation, and system identification. The contents are as follows:

- **data/**: Directory for storing data files generated or used by the lab's scripts.
- **diff_robot.png**: An image file, likely representing a differential robot used in the lab.
- **s0_signal_generator.py**: Script to generate signals.
- **s0_test_2motorControl.py**: Script to test the control of two motors.
- **s1_plot_step_response.py**: Script to plot the step response of a system.
- **s1_txt_to_csv.py**: Converts text files to CSV format.
- **s2_motor_simulation.py**: Simulates motor behavior.
- **s2_system_identification.m**: MATLAB script for system identification.
- **s3_test_error.py**: Script to test errors in the system.
- **s4_evaluate_kinematic_error.py**: Evaluates kinematic errors.
- **s4_test_kinematics.py**: Tests the kinematics of the system.

### Lab 03

This lab includes scripts and data related to odometry testing:

- **data/**: Directory for storing data files related to odometry tests.
- **s0_test_odometry.py**: Script to test odometry functionality.

## Usage

Each lab is designed to be run independently. Navigate to the appropriate lab directory and execute the scripts as required. Ensure that any dependencies or prerequisites are installed and configured properly before running the scripts.

For detailed instructions on running specific scripts, refer to the comments and documentation within each script file.
